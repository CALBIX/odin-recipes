    <h1>Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches</h1>
    <p>This crockpot Buffalo chicken is great for hearty sandwiches that will please those who love Buffalo chicken
        wings. This
        recipe is perfect for those days spent watching football. I like to top these with blue cheese or ranch
        dressing.</p>
